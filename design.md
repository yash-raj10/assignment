 ### Scaling Strategy for High Throughput gRPC Service

To handle 10,000 concurrent gRPC requests per second across multiple data centers, we can take the following approach:

---

#### 1. Horizontal Scaling

We'll deploy multiple instances of our gRPC service using Kubernetes. This allows the service to automatically scale up or down depending on the traffic. By spreading instances across multiple regions and availability zones, we make sure the system stays available even if one location goes down.

#### 2. Use Sharded, Persistent Storage

* Replace in-memory map with a persistent, horizontally scalable database: PostgreSQL or Redis for fast and distributed interaction.

* Add Redis for caching recent/frequent reports.

#### 3. gRPC Load Balancing

* Use NGINX as a gRPC-aware load balancer.

#### 5. Monitoring, Observability & CI/CD

We can keep an eye on the system using Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics. Logs will be collected using Loki. Alerts will notify us about slowdowns, errors, or unusual spikes in traffic.
Lastly, we can automate our deployments using GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
